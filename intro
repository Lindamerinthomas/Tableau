Data analyst tool 

To become a data analyst, you’ll need some data to practice and build projects with. Here are 11 websites to download free datasets.

1. Kaggle ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gq8fUDy2

Kaggle is a popular website where anyone can upload datasets. The cool thing about Kaggle is you can use the search function to find data you’re interested in.

2. iPums ➡️ https://www.ipums.org

iPums is a great place to get survey data from all around the world on topics such as health, higher education, and housing. As a matter of fact, I used iPums data for my senior project in college.

The downside of iPums is it’s tricky to use at first, but YouTube and some good ole trial and error is all you need to figure it out

3. Tableau Public ➡️ https://lnkd.in/g52vGrQP

Tableau Public (the website you can also use to download a free version of Tableau) has a few really cool datasets covering superstore sales, employment, Netflix, Pokémon, sports, and more.

While there isn’t a huge volume of datasets here, the ones listed can be fun to play around with.

4. Google Dataset Search ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gPtSpAjU

This is a cool website hosted by Google (surprise!) that allows you to search the web for data. This website involves a little more work than searching Kaggle, but you can usually use this search engine to find reputable datasets.

5. FiveThirtyEight ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gTN9PuNS

538 is a statistics-driven news site well-known for its political and sports coverage. The cool thing about 538 is they publish the data they use for their news articles. 

It might be fun to see what data visualizations they used in the article and try to recreate them yourself using Tableau or Power BI. 

6. Data(dot)gov https://data.gov

On this government website, you can search for government datasets to use for your projects. I haven’t used this one much, but a lot of people really like using this site for real government data.

7. Maven Analytics ➡️ https://lnkd.in/g5yJiMrZ

Maven is a popular website for data learners, and they have some really cool datasets to do projects with. Their website is one of the easiest to navigate too!

8. Datahub(dot)io ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gn_QBcGS

This website has some cool datasets organized by category.

9. WHO Global Health Observatory ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gsHGsgsj

This is the World Health Organization website with a ton of great health-related datasets. 

If you’re interested in research or healthcare, this is a great resource.

10. UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gf_HqQVm

This website has a ton of datasets used by machine learning enthusiasts. It’s like I always say: if it’s good enough for machine learning enthusiasts, it’s good enough for me.

11. Data(dot)world ➡️ https://lnkd.in/gW3zcynz
